QuizApp using Angular & ASP.Net WebAPI

- This is a fun application that gives a quiz on common knowledge in the field of computers.

- Please use the DBScript.sql to create & insert records into the database with two tables; 'Participant' and 'Question'. I have used SQL Server Management Studio & local server for managing the database. 

- Please change the WebApi DB Connection String as per your configuration.

- The Angular application is in QuizApp folder & the WebApi solution is in WebAPI folder.

Thank you.
